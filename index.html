            <div class="column main-content" style="background: rgba(192,192,192,0.1);">I have been stayring home for the past 20 years while raising my children. During this time I kept busy by learning many skills and starting a part-time photography and design business. When I couldnâ€™t find a website template that worked for me, I taught myself SwishMax (a cheaper version of Flash) and created some templates that I sold to other photographers. Once Flash was no longer a viable option for websites, I picked up WordPress and began customizing themes for other photography clients. Along the way I began offering logo & branding design. Over the past several years, I was working part-time at my local Target store and noticed that I tried to analyze all the different systems that they used. And another project that I had volutneered for has made me realize that I miss the ability to solve problems on a larger level than just making something look pretty.</div>
